I'm PhD student at the Applied Intelligent Systems Laboratory (AISLab) at the University of Milan.<br>
* **Supervisor:** Prof. [Nicola Basilico](https://basilico.di.unimi.it)
* **Co-supervisor:** Doc. [Matteo Luperto](http://luperto.di.unimi.it)

My research activity investigates  <b>Domain Adaptation</b> for Robotic Vision.
Indoor mobile robots need to perceive high-level semantic features from the environment
and a straightforward way to implement such a capability is ot plug and play publicly-available models based on deep learning.
A key limitation of these models is that they have not been trained to be used by mobile robots and will suffer from  domain shift when deployed on robots. 
My research is focused on adapting these modules for the specific needs of robots operating indoors.
